Designed Floating Point Multiplication and Verified Using systemverilog Testbench using SV constructs Interface ,Assertions, Coverages,Constrined -Randomization and verified all corner cases and took coverage metrics
Designed and created a SystemVerilog testbench environment with SV interface, test cases for design correctness, and
 monitored progress by deploying verification techniques assertions and coverage driven verification.
â€¢ Created Constrained-random test with specified constraints and achieved 95% coverage for stimulus and corner cases.
